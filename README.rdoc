== Chess App

This is a simple chess application using bootstrap glyphicons.

Things to improve:

*Set up droppable class to click elements to place

*Set up allowable moves for each type of piece

*Use JavaScript to move class names of glyphicons

*Collect position data in database

*Use Pusher API to push changes for 2 players simultaneously

*Add stylized timer that changes with player moves

*Add interface for users to choose opponents / timing of play
